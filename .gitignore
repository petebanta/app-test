# GIT IGNORE: Standard Web Project Template
# Created for a basic HTML/CSS/JS/Media project structure.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Ignore common package manager directories (if you ever add Node.js/npm)
node_modules/
bower_components/

# 2. OPERATING SYSTEM & EDITOR FILES
# Ignore standard files created by macOS, Windows, or Linux when browsing folders
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

# 3. ENVIRONMENT & LOGS
# Ignore files related to build, logging, or temporary development

*.log
npm-debug.log*

# 4. IGNORE SPECIFIC EDITOR/IDE FILES
# Visual Studio Code
.vscode/

# 5. GIMP & IMAGE PROCESSING FILES
# Ignore temporary files created by GIMP, Photoshop, etc.
*.xcf~
*.xcf.bak
*.psd
*.tmp

# 6. LARGE/PROCESSED MEDIA FILES
# If we decide to use a dedicated folder for web-optimized videos, we should ignore the originals.
# This keeps the repo lean by focusing only on the code.
# The `media/source_videos/` folder you mentioned could be ignored entirely if the raw files are huge.
# media/source_videos/
# (If we decide to keep the videos in the repo, just delete the line above.)
