# app-test
Welcome!

This repo is for storing all files and assets for the one page scoreboard player test app I am building from prompts using Gemini Pro. The one page test here is meant to test the user controls and the viewer scoreboard "player" basic functionality and experiences and presentation people will experience, but on the same page using JavaScript. 

Later, we will build web-based CRUD app using the LAMP stack for a web-based site (scoreboardr.app) that houses accounts to use the app there, based around the same designs and basic controls->player functionality, but served out of the web site for easy access (without downloads/app stores), and ability to have the user make updates from one page and then have anyone view player see those updates/media in near real-time from another site page.

The /docs folder of the repo has .txt files which outline the basic structure of the controls/player and relationships of controls to their corresponding places in the scoreboard player display, as well as basic file and element structures and details to build all the necessary form components and how their controls will operate to cause changes in the scoreboard display spaces/layers. Additionally, I outlined higher level layout and design, and provided pixel-perfect mobile-first mock-ups to serve for guiding the visual design and layouts.

I have decided to use Google products for all aspects of the project, except perhaps some design and creation of the more basic marketing pages for the app/site later. I am having Gemini Pro handle the heavy lifting of complex JavaScript and PHP coding while I guide the general functionality, user experience and visual design of the app. I am additionally using Google Pro AI tools for asset creation, leaning heavily on Gemini for static drawing, and FLOW for video animations. I am excited to see how quickly we can build a working web-based fun application together! :D
