SCOREBOARD BASE LAYER OVERALL STYLES:
All responsive with font/margins/etc in relative units (ie. em) and div size and arrangement based on viewport %'s
Small (ie. 10px) space around and between all display divs
Rounded edges 30px radius with drop shadow on boxes and texts right/down
All media/images in lightboxes will auto fit for centered in viewport and 100% width (so you can still see full videos, if viewport in portrait)

DISPLAY DIV BASE STYLES & COLORS;
AWAY (div id="away_score"): #2c2c2c Texts / #f6f6f6 Background
HOME (div id="home_score"): #4f4f4f Texts / #3c3c3c Background
INNING (div id="inning"): #e1e1e1 Texts / #5b5b5b Background
OUTS (div id="outs"): #f6f6f6 Texts /  #2c2c2c Background
BASES (div id="bases_display"): div background color is #03740c (this is same color as green in the base runner images, so it will look seamless when the jpg is centered in that space at larger div sizes)

HEADER AND DISPLAY VALUE TEXTS STYLES;
*Shown in em's for best fit centered left/right and top/bottom*
ie Verdana Bold 32px for Header Texts in current pixel-perfect design mock-ups
ie Verdana 256px for Main Texts in current pixel-perfect design mock-ups

Or, in terms of relative scaling, there is a 1:8 ratio for header vs main texts inside a div/scoreboard object.
Except for Inning and Outs displays, where there is a 1:7 ratio for header vs inning/out texts in mock-ups.
(In demo, this shown as 224px and tighter spacing between the letters for best fit)

The value displayed for OUT object will have text color styles based on the value selected as outlined below:
Out "0" text is shown in #36c63f Green
Out 1 text is #ffd310 Yellow
Out 2 text is #ef3b25 Red
