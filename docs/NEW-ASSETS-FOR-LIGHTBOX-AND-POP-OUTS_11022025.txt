(to place in upper right corner of video lightbox, calling to close the window, if viewer wants to stop it early)

(once player/control panel are built, clicking this image will call JS which will make that section/div "pop-out" to full screen view, for maximum viewport real estate and no extra space from page/browser/etc.). 

It should have an escape/close function/button in upper right corner, to escape full page view. Use assets/images/pop-back-in.png
